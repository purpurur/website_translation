Every iDApp will have a fee structure that will cover: iDApp developer bounty, TOR-X team audit costs, Miner bounty. This approach is going to prevent the occurrence of malicious applications and suspicious activity on the one hand and stimulate creative developers to invent and deploy useful DApps and iDApps on the other hand.",
